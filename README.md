##Open Research Process

Securosis has long followed our [Totally Transparent Research process](https://securosis.com/about/totally-transparent-research) where we post all draft research on the blog for public comment and review. I'm experimenting with using GitHub as a more-interactive way of opening up this process, since people can now directly propose and submit changes. This will also expose more of our editing process.

This paper is being posted as a complete first draft, but most papers will be posted in pieces as we put them up on the blog. We will collect feedback from both systems, especially since this paper is our first foray into using GitHub to write research.

Please post suggestions here, or feel free to email me at rmogull@securosis.com
